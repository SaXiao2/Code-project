# Code-project
The project called "Final_project" is a project I used Python to predict the movement of DJIA index. This project include some interesting variables like sentiment variable and United States interest rate.
The data of this project is download from google finance.

The project called "Exh 14- " is a project I finished in RailTEC group. The purpose of this project is to use code to automatically grab data from multiple databases and automatically generate the required plots. 
It's not the final version of the project, I'm currently trying to figure out how to get code to automatically grab the data and create a whole new database. This will make it easier for RailTEC to use the relevant data at any time in the future.
The data of this project is confidential. I get permission from our group to share the code and some of the plots.
